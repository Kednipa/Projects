# Projects
These are all projects completed over the course of three years at college that are based on a website, a database, and a user interface. The project's specifics will be discussed.

 PIPET Hospital 

  The PIPET Hospital project began with our friend's cat, who was frequently ill and required frequent visits to the veterinarian. He has to wait too long to for find his cat records is difficult because they are written on paper, so we came up with an idea that we will implement. Pipet Hospital is a high-end pet hospital with a modern approach to treating various types of pets by a team of talented veterinarians. Pipet hospitals became very popular among pet owners after this point. The number of pets visiting our hospital is rapidly increasing. As a result, we decided to build the website. Our goal is to make it easier for all veterinarians and nursing staff to view and update information about patients and their owners.<br />

 TTB Mobile banking redesign application
  According to the UX/UI design challenge, we were asked to redesign a mobile banking application. I chose TTB touch because the pain point that I surveyed said that ttb touch always breaks and cannot be used, so I redesign to make it look safe and restore customer trust.<br />
